    <p>Hi, I'm Will Scott. I'm interested in IT and computer programming as well as experimenting with different projects to see what I can build</p>
    <p>I'm currently interested in web development, robotics programming, and general programming but I'm open to other fields of work.</p>
    <p>I hope to approach work with openness, integrity, and humility &mdash; values I hope to grow into over time. I believe in being honest, patient, and willing to learn from mistakes as I develop my skills.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects, playing around with code and cloning certain games, and seeing what i can build.</p>
    <p>I graduated from Central Piedmont Community College in 2025 with a certificate in Information Technology in full stack programming and am based in Charlotte, NC.</p>
