        <p>Hi, I'm Will Scott. I'm interested in IT and computer programming and enjoy experimenting with various projects to see what I can build.
          Right now I'm focused on web development, robotics programming, and general software work, though I'm open to other fields.
          I aim to approach every job with openness, integrity, and humility — values I hope to cultivate over time.
          I also believe in being honest, patient, and willing to learn from mistakes as I develop my skills.</p>
        <br />
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects, playing around with code, cloning certain games, and experimenting with different mechanics.
          I graduated from Central Piedmont Community College in 2025 with a certificate in Information Technology in Full Stack Programming. I'm currently based in Charlotte, NC.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Available for hire or freelance work. Let's build something great!</p>
